Welcome to the Neural-Network-Character-Recognition GitHub repository! 
This react application allows you to hand-draw digits and letters from the English alphabet while a neural network actively guesses your work.

# Features: #
* Features 2 independent neural networks that can perform live, hand-drawn digit and letter recognition
* the digit model was trained in PyTorch using a convolutional neural network - more than 92% accurate
* the letter model was trained in PyTorch using a regular, fully connected neural network - less accurate than the digit model (around 80%)


# Usage: #
